# algorithms
Repository for many algorithms coded in Scala.

## Purpose
This repository provides the implementation of various algorithms in implemented in Scala.

The purpose of this repo is to reacquaint myself with various algorithms used in computer science, as well as their spacial and time complexities.

My goal is to implement at least one algorithm a day.

## Todo
### Sorting
Note: not going to do bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, etc. (too inefficient).
- count sort
- radix sort
- heap sort
- quick sort
- merge sort
