# algorithms
Repository for many algorithms coded in C++, and Scala.

## Purpose
This repository provides the implementation of various algorithms in implemented in C++, and Scala.

The purpose of this repo is to reacquaint myself with various algorithms used in computer science, as well as their spacial and time complexities.

My goal is to implement at least one algorithm a day.
